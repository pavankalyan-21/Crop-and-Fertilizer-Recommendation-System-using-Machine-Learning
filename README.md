# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The **Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to help farmers and agricultural experts make informed decisions about the most suitable crops to grow based on environmental and soil conditions. The system leverages data on soil nutrients, weather conditions, and other parameters to recommend the best crop for a given region.

---

## Features
- Recommends optimal crops based on input parameters such as:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Soil pH
  - Rainfall
- Provides visual insights into the dataset through data analysis and visualization.
- Implements machine learning techniques for accurate crop predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 2,200 samples with the following features:

| Feature        | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **N**          | Nitrogen content in soil                      |
| **P**          | Phosphorus content in soil                   |
| **K**          | Potassium content in soil                    |
| **Temperature**| Average temperature (in Celsius)             |
| **Humidity**   | Humidity level (%)                           |
| **pH**         | pH level of the soil                         |
| **Rainfall**   | Rainfall (in mm)                             |
| **Label**      | Recommended crop                             |

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
